# Euc

A software rendering crate that lets you write shaders in Rust.

## Example

`todo`

## Why?

- Writing rendering code on the CPU requires significantly less boilerplate setup code than on the GPU, and so is brilliant for playing around with ideas.

- Modern CPUs are fast enough to make lightweight software-rendered programs run at reasonable speeds (although they are of course no match for GPUs).

- Writing a software renderer is a brilliant way to learn about modern 3D rendering techniques.
